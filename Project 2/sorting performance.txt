The run time of  our heap sort was approximately _____ while the run time of our hashtable was _____. The general performance of heapSort has a runtime of O(nlongn) because it calls buildMaxHeap which is a function with runtime O(nlogn), a for loop with O(n) runtime, two lines with constant O(1) runtime and maxHeapify with a runtime of O(logn). Heap sort creates a local heap that has words added to it which is then sorted and copied to a vector. On the other hand, hashTable are direct address tables where each element has a key. In the worst case scenario, being all elements hash to the same location, the runtime is O(n) in addition to the amount of time it takes to complete the hash function.
